# schema.contrib

![The Schema Toolbox](resources/icon.png)

The schema contributitons library is a collection of namespaces, each
of which implements features that we believe may be useful to a large
part of the `prismatic/schema` community.

## Status

 * ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cddr/schema.contrib.svg)

## Usage

### schema.contrib.number

`schema.contrib.number` provides helpers for building number validators

    (ns my.app
      (:require [schema.contrib.number :as num]))
    
    (def schema
      {:rev-share (num/between 0 1)
       :age (num/gt 21)
       :income (num/lt 100000)})

### schema.contrib.human

`schema.contrib.human` provides functions that produce errors intended
for end-users

    (ns my.app
      (:require [schema.contrib.human :as hum]
                [schema.contrib.number :as num]
                [schema.core :as s]))
    
    (defn show-errors [input-val]
      (human-explain (s/check
                       {:name s/Str
                        :age (num/gt 21)})
        input-val))
    
    (show-errors {:name "foo" :age 25})
    =>nil
    
    (show-errors {:name 42 :age 25})
    42 is not a valid java.lang.String
    =>nil
    
    (show-errors {:name "Billy the kid" :age 18})
    18 is not gt 21
    =>nil
    
    (defn show-composite-errors [input-val]
      (human-explain (s/check
                       {:yolo (s/either
                                s/Str
                                (num/lt 42))})
        input-val))
    
    (show-errors {:yolo 100})
    100 fails all of the following:-
      it is not a java.lang.String
      it is not lt 42
    =>nil

When using schema's `pred` type constructor, be sure to give your predicate
a name which satisfies the function `human-expectation?`. This should ensure
that the information needed by `ValidationTransformer` to print a human
readable message is attached to your predicate function.

## Contributing

If you've found a bug, you have the following options, ordered by usefulness
to the community

1. Issue a pull request that contains a test that fails against a released
   version, together with a change that fixes the test.
2. Create an issue describing the minimal steps to reproduce; the version
   of the project you are using; what you see; and what you expected to see
3. Create an issue describing the problem in as much detail as you can

If you have an idea for a feature, make github issue and lets talk about it

### Developer Tooling

Please consider adding this [pre-commit hook](https://gist.github.com/cddr/9906472)
to your local repo to ensure the Changelog is kept up-to-date

### Running the tests

Before issuing a pull request, please use the following command to ensure
the unit tests pass and the API docs can be generated
```
$ lein do clean, test && bash test/tooling.sh
```
